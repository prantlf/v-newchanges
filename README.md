# New Changes (Changelog) Generator

Creates or updates the changelog file from commit messages formatted according to [Conventional Commits].

> The [Conventional Commits] is a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages. It's a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with [Semantic Versioning], by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

About writing commit messages, see [A Note About Git Commit Messages], [How to Write a Git Commit Message] and [Git Commit Good Practice]. See also the tool [vp] for automating the whole package publishing.

[Node.js] users can install this tool using [node-newchanges] too.

## Synopsis

Update `CHANGELOG.md` automatically from the commit messages:

    ‚ùØ newchanges
    discovered 1 classified commit from 1 total since v0.2.1
    version 0.3.0 (2023-08-13) and 10 lines written to "./CHANGELOG.md"

  fix: Ensure error location by custom parsing

  The native JSON.parse does not always provide the error location
  at the end of the error message. These two invalid inputs either
  include or not include the error location and it is different
  with Node.js 18 and Node.js 20:

    { "foo": \"baz }
    { "foo": baz }

  If the location is missing, let us parse the input once more
  by the custom parser, which always provides the error location.

  feat: Support JSON Schema drafts 2019-09 and 2020-12 and JSON Type Definition

  Upgrade AJV to the latest version and retain the previous AJV@6
  to be able to suport JSON Schema draft 04.

  BREAKING CHANGE: The default environment recognises only JSON Schema drafts
  06 and 07 automatically. Not 04 any more. The environment for JSON Schema
  drafts 04 has to be selected explicitly. Also, JSON Schema drafts 06 and 07
  are handled by AJV@8 instead of AJV@6. It shouldn't make any difference,
  but the implementation is new and could perform a stricter validation.
